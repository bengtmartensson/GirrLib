# GirrLib
This "project" consists of "my" collection of [Girr](http://www.harctoolbox.org/Girr.html) files.

This is not yet another collection of IR files, but rather a few files I have created that I would like to organize in a clean way.

The prime interactive tool for transformation to and from the Girr format is [IrScrutinizer](http://www.harctoolbox.org/IrScrutinizer.html).

Within [harctoolbox bundle](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle) the sub-project Girr contains a Java API for generating, reading and manipulating Girr files.

As opposed to my other projects, the individual files within _this_ project are in the public domain, unless otherwise stated.
